### OJOC ###

Jodel is an app aimed at university students, allowing the users to share
thoughts and pictures anonymously.

I wanted to assess the latter part by [sniffing](https://mitmproxy.org/)
the traffic between my cell phone and the Jodel server.

The API used by the app is quite simple; out of the curiosity regarding
the app's communication grew an almost full-featured open implementation
of a Jodel client called _Open JOdel Client_ (OJOC)
in Python. 

Give it a try if you are interested: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/cfib90/ojoc" class="btn btn-default">It's on bitbucket</a>
