## Hi, welcome to `kbyte.io` ##

### My name is Christian and this is my homepage. ###

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I write code for anything between 8 and 64 bits as well as code that
makes up these things.

This has been going on since I discovered BASIC in the user manual
of my uncle's well-preserved Commodore 128 in the early 2000s. Since
then I ventured into C, VHDL & Verilog, Python, Perl, Bash, Assembly,
Tcl/Tk, Java and many more.

I don't use `GOTO` that often. I can quit any time I want.

My background is in electronics, so I occasionally solder things together
and/or design a PCB. Since I learned about gates, flip-flops, counters
(good old 40xx), I have been hooked onto digital logic design.
The endless possibilities provided by programmable logic (mostly FPGA)
still fascinate me. 

This happens to be the field I am currently working in at the University of Applied
Sciences Technikum Wien as a researcher. We are currently developing new methods
to improve verification of embedded systems, with me focusing on PLD verification
and testing.

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I am also into (tech-)history,
(analog) photography and developing, urban (and sometimes rural) exploring,
and running.

Here, at `kbyte.io`, I want to share my discoveries, projects, and thoughts.
